<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Named after the iconic spell from Dungeons & Dragons, Fireball aims to serve as a software tool to visualize 3D environments for tabletop roleplaying games (TTRPGs). Many existing platforms for TTRPGs operate on a 2-dimensional map for the sake of simplicity even though the rules support 3D movement. The rules for combat in TTRPGs are notoriously complex and require precise measurements for positioning, range, and areas of effects for various attacks and magical spell effects. For example, players and enemies can fly or stand at different elevations, and spells can be shaped as spheres, cones, cylinders, cubes, or planes of varying dimensions. During combat, taking time to measure out distance and area slows the pace of the game to a halt, which can diminish the fun of the game. Existing tabletop platforms — physical, digital, and imaginary — struggle to communicate three-dimensional space in a user-friendly manner, so this project aims to provide a solution. </p>
<p>Users can use this program to measure distance and volume within virtual 3-dimensional environments, and the interface will tell the user if objects and creatures are within the range and area-of-effect (AoE) of their attacks, according to the rules of whatever game system the user is playing. Users will have the ability to create and edit environments and perform accurate measurements for use in their own games. This project will be built using Unreal Engine 5 for the rendering engine, using free and open-source assets for visuals.
